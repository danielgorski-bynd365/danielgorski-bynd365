### Hi there 👋


Hello, fellow innovators and creators! I'm Daniel Gorski, the founder of BEYONDIT GmbH, and live nearby Kiel with my wife and two kids. 🚀

My adventure started in the realm of software development, where my passion for Microsoft Dynamics ignited a deeper pursuit to revolutionize traditional business processes. Now, as a seasoned architect in Microsoft Dynamics NAV and Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central, I design advanced solutions that promote efficiency and foster innovation. 📷

At beyondit, we stand unique in our approach—melding deep empathy for client challenges with the latest in technological advancements to solutions that uniquely fit each business's needs. We pride ourselves on being not just solution providers but partners in our clients’ successes, propelling businesses into new realms of potential. 🏡

Beyond the realms of technology, I am an avid basketball player and mountain biking enthusiast. These activities not only challenge me physically but also keep me balanced and invigorated, ready to tackle the next challenge. Whether I’m on the court or navigating a tricky trail, I bring the same energy and determination as I do to my professional work.  🏀🚵‍♂️

If you share a passion for harnessing the full capabilities of Microsoft's ecosystems and want to transform business landscapes, let's connect. Join me in this journey to innovate and excel. Together, let’s script the future and thrive in the ever-evolving world of technology. Let’s make magic happen! 🌟🔧📈
